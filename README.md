# Horiseon-Marketing-Webpage

## Refactorisation with the aim of improving accessibility and long term maintenance

The goal of this project was  to condense and consolidate the existing code without changing the function.

- Html code was given semantic elements to improve the user accesibility and to facilitate future developers with any maintenance. 
- Css code was consolidated, ie. ridding the codebase of any unnecessary repetition of code with the aim of again, aiding in the ease of maintenance for future developers.
- Css was also restructured to follow the semantic html for legibility purposes.
